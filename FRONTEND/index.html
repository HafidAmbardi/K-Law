                                I've been experiencing some serious workplace discrimination, and it's making it incredibly difficult for me
                                to do my job effectively. It feels like no matter what I do, I'm constantly overlooked for opportunities,

                                ignored in meetings, and my ideas are dismissed without consideration. I've tried bringing it up with HR,
                                but they seem to brush it off or make excuses. I love my job and I'm passionate about what I do, but this
                                discrimination is taking a toll on my mental health and my ability to perform. Has anyone else experienced
                                something similar at HYBE or have any advice on how to handle this situation? I'm feeling really lost and frustrated right now.</span></p>

                                Hey guys, I really need to get this off my chest. I've been working at SM Entertainment for a while now, and I can't shake off the feeling of being unfairly treated. Not only am I constantly facing discrimination based on my gender and age, but the wage disparities within the company are staggering. It's disheartening to see certain colleagues, often those with less experience or contribution, getting paid significantly more than others.                          <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more"><br><br>
                                And when it comes to promotions or career advancement, it feels like a never-ending battle, with favoritism playing a huge role. I've tried raising these concerns internally, but it seems like they fall on deaf ears. Has anyone else encountered similar issues at SM or have any advice on how to navigate this frustrating situation? I'm at a loss here and could really use some support.       </span></p>

                                As a former staff member in the K-pop industry, discrimination was an all-too-common experience. Despite my dedication and hard work, I faced constant reminders that I didn't fit the mold of what was expected. Being a foreigner in Korea compounded these challenges, with colleagues often treating me as an outsider. Snide remarks and dismissive attitudes were just the beginning, as I found myself overlooked for promotions and opportunities solely because of who I am.
                                <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more"><br><br>
                                    Moreover, as a woman, I encountered additional barriers. Harassment and inappropriate comments from higher-ups were distressingly common, creating a toxic work environment that left me feeling vulnerable and powerless. Despite reporting these incidents, little was done to address the issue, leaving me to navigate a hostile landscape where my worth was constantly undermined. Even something as fundamental as fair compensation was elusive, as I watched my male counterparts receive higher salaries and better treatment while I was left with meager pay for my efforts. My experience highlights the urgent need for change in the K-pop industry, where equality and respect must become non-negotiable standards for all.

                                In the quest for perfection, many in the K-pop industry are willing to sacrifice their health and well-being. As a trainee, I was pushed to the brink of exhaustion with relentless rehearsals and strict dieting regimens. The pressure to maintain a certain image took a toll on my physical and mental health, leading to chronic stress, eating disorders, and even depression. Despite voicing my concerns, I was met with dismissiveness and told to prioritize my career above all else. This culture of neglecting health in pursuit of success is not only unsustainable but also deeply harmful, underscoring the need for greater emphasis on holistic well-being within the industry.

                                    Despite the challenges I faced, I refused to sacrifice my health and happiness for the sake of my career. By prioritizing self-care and advocating for greater support and resources for artists struggling with mental and physical health issues, I hope to spark a much-needed conversation about the importance of well-being in the K-pop industry and drive positive change for future generations of artists.

                                As a backup dancer in the K-pop industry, I've witnessed firsthand the stark wage disparity that plagues our profession. Despite contributing to the success of countless performances, we are often paid mere fractions of what the idols earn. Our hard work and dedication are undervalued, leaving us struggling to make ends meet while the spotlight shines brightly on others. This wage inequality perpetuates a system where the labor of many is exploited for the profit of a few, highlighting the urgent need for fair compensation across all roles within the industry.

                                    Despite these challenges, many of us continue to pursue our passion for dance, driven by a love for our craft and a desire to share our talents with the world. However, without fair compensation and recognition for our contributions, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain a career in an industry that thrives on our talent and dedication. It's time for the K-pop industry to acknowledge the vital role that backup dancers play in its success and ensure that we are compensated fairly for our hard work and dedication.</span></p>
